In this chapter, we are going to work with downloaded data, a vast amount of unanalyzed data can be found online, which
hasn't been analyzed by anyone, thus we can find very interesting an unique patterns in that data and can find some
meaningful conclusions.

The 2 most common data formats we'll be working with is the .csv and .json format, we will then use Matplotlib to
visualize the data.

* csv's can be tricky and hard for humans to read, but it is a very common way to store and load data to programs, thus
speeding the data analysis process.

* Next we are going to create a .py file named highs_lows.py and do the rest.
